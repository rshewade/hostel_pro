# Front-End Specification: Hostel Management Application

## 1. Design Philosophy & Visual System

*   **Design Framework:** A blend of **Institutional Discipline** and **Service Transparency**.
*   **Colors (BRD Strict):**
    *   **Primary:** `Institutional Blue` (Logo-derived) - Used for Headers, Navigation, and Key Actions.
    *   **Accent:** `Brownish-Yellow` (Logo-derived) - Used for CTA highlights and semantic differentiation.
    *   **Interface Theme:** `White & Blue` (Clean, professional background).
*   **Typography:** Professional Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto) for high readability across all roles. Emphasis on clear hierarchy for status and data.
*   **Layout Style (Reference Inspired):**
    *   **Modern Cards:** Use of elevated white containers on a light background to separate Student Stats, Notifications, and Fee Cards.
    *   **Visual Step-Flow:** Visual status tracker for the admission journey: `Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Interview → Approved → Checked-in`.
