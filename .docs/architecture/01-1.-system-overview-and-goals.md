## 1. System Overview & Goals


The Hostel Management Application follows a **Three-Tier Architecture** optimized for strict institutional governance and DPDP compliance.

### Key Architectural Goals
1.  **Guest-First Admissions:** Support mobile-verified applicants without requiring persistent user accounts until final admission approval.
2.  **Strict Multi-Tenancy/Role Separation:** Enforce RBAC at the API and Database (RLS) levels.
3.  **Audit-Ready Event Logging:** Every state change triggers an immutable audit log entry.
4.  **Immutable Document Integrity:** PDF generation for all legal undertakings and financial receipts stored in secure S3 buckets.
