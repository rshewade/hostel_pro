## Critical Gaps Summary (UPDATED)

### High Priority Gaps

**NONE** - All critical gaps have been addressed ✅

### Medium Priority Gaps (Previously Identified)

1. ~~**Subtask 3.6 - Validation Process**~~ → **RESOLVED**
   - ✅ ~~Missing stakeholder review schedule~~ → Created in validation plan
   - ✅ ~~Missing card-sorting methodology~~ → Detailed in validation plan
   - ✅ ~~Missing tree-testing methodology~~ → Detailed in validation plan
   - ✅ ~~Missing validation workshop outline~~ → Lifecycle walkthroughs defined

**NONE REMAINING**

### Low Priority Gaps (Unchanged)

1. **Visual Flow Diagrams** (Not a blocker)
   - Current: Text-based ASCII diagrams
   - Ideal: Visual flowcharts (Mermaid, Lucidchart, etc.)
   - Impact: Low - Text diagrams are sufficient for Phase 1
   - Recommendation: Create visual diagrams in future iterations

2. **Future Module Navigation Details** (Not needed yet)
   - Current: Placeholder routes only
   - Ideal: Detailed navigation structure for future modules
   - Impact: Low - Not needed until modules are designed
   - Recommendation: Expand during future module PRD phase
