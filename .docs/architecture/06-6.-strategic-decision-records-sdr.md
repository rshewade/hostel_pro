## 6. Strategic Decision Records (SDR)


### SDR-002: Guest-First Application Strategy
**Status:** APPROVED
**Context:** To lower friction and comply with DPDP, we avoid creating a full "User Account" for rejected or abandoned applications.
**Decision:** Applicants use OTP-verified sessions to track applications. A permanent `User` record is only created upon successful admission.

### SDR-003: PDF vs. Web-Only Undertakings
**Status:** APPROVED
**Context:** Institutional audits require signed, printable proof of rules acceptance.
**Decision:** All approvals will trigger a background job to generate a "Final Admission Packet" PDF containing student data and accepted terms, stored in S3.
