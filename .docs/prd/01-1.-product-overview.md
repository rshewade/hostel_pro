## 1. Product Overview

Design a web-based Hostel Management Application for a Jain Hostel (covering Boys Hostel, Girls Ashram, and Dharamshala) that manages the complete lifecycle of a student/resident, starting from admission application through approvals, interviews, payments, room allocation, stay management, renewal (every 6 months), and final exit, with strict governance, auditability, and institutional discipline.
The system must support multi-role workflows, manual approvals, formal undertakings, financial tracking, parent communication, and DPDP Act compliance.
