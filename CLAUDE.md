## Project Overview

**Hostel Management Application** for a Jain Hostel system covering Boys Hostel, Girls Ashram, and Dharamshala. The application manages the complete resident lifecycle from admission application through approvals, interviews, payments, room allocation, stay management, 6-month renewals, and final exit with strict institutional governance, auditability, and DPDP Act compliance.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-role workflows (Applicants, Residents, Superintendents, Trustees, Accounts, Parents)
- Guest-first admission flow (OTP-verified applications without requiring accounts)
- Manual approval workflows with interview scheduling
- Financial tracking with multi-head accounting
- Document management and PDF generation for legal undertakings
- Leave management with parent notifications
- 6-month renewal cycle management
- Exit and alumni tracking
- Complete audit logging

## Development Commands

**Note:** This project is in early stages. Package.json and source code directories have not yet been created. Commands will be added once the project structure is initialized.

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Prototyping with db.json (Current)**

```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js frontend (port 3000)
npm run dev:api      # json-server mock API (port 3001)
npm run dev:all      # Run both concurrently
```

**Phase 2: Hybrid Development**

- Supabase Auth for authentication
- db.json for remaining data operations
- Gradual backend migration

**Phase 3: Production Setup**

- Full Supabase PostgreSQL backend
- NestJS API with RLS enabled
- Complete security implementation

See `.docs/db-json-prototyping-guide.md` for detailed setup and migration instructions.

## Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture optimized for institutional governance:

1. **Frontend (Next.js):**
   - Public landing pages with vertical selection (Boys/Girls/Dharamshala)
   - Guest application tracking (OTP-verified, no persistent accounts)
   - Role-based dashboards post-authentication
   - Mobile-first responsive design

2. **Backend (NestJS):**
   - RESTful API with role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Business logic layer for pricing, approvals, renewals
   - PDF generation service for legal documents
   - Job queue integration for async notifications

3. **Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase):**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
   - Audit logging for all state changes
   - Document storage with signed URLs

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Guest-First Admissions:** Applicants use OTP-verified sessions to submit and track applications. A permanent User account is created ONLY after final approval to reduce friction and comply with DPDP Act.
- **Tagged Task Lists:** Applications route to specific Superintendents based on vertical (Boys/Girls/Dharamshala).
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** All application status changes and financial transactions create immutable audit log entries.
- **PDF Generation:** All approvals trigger background jobs to generate "Final Admission Packet" PDFs with accepted terms, stored in S3-compatible storage.

### Core Data Schema

**Applications Lifecycle:**

- `id` (UUID), `tracking_number` (human-readable)
- `type` (NEW, RENEWAL), `parent_application_id` (for renewal history)
- `applicant_mobile` (OTP-verified, used before User creation)
- `student_user_id` (nullable, populated after approval)
- `current_status` (DRAFT, SUBMITTED, REVIEW, INTERVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED, ARCHIVED)
- `data` (jsonb) - Stores all form responses

**User Roles:**

- STUDENT (Residents with full dashboard access)
- SUPERINTENDENT (Boys/Girls/Dharamshala specific)
- TRUSTEE (Interview and final approval authority)
- ACCOUNTS (Financial tracking and receipt generation)
- PARENT (View-only, OTP-based login)

## Design System

**Colors (Logo-Derived):**

- **Primary:** Institutional Blue (Headers, Navigation, Key Actions)
- **Accent:** Brownish-Yellow (CTA highlights, semantic differentiation)
- **Interface Theme:** White & Blue (Clean, professional background)

**Typography:** Professional Sans-Serif (Inter/Roboto) for high readability

**Layout Style:**

- Modern elevated card containers on light backgrounds
- Visual step-flow for admission journey: Draft → Submitted → Review → Interview → Approved → Checked-in
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Code Conventions

### File Naming

- **Frontend Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `ApplicationForm.tsx`, `StudentDashboard.tsx`)
- **Backend Services:** kebab-case (e.g., `application.service.ts`, `pdf-generation.service.ts`)
- **Database Tables/Columns:** snake_case (e.g., `applications`, `student_user_id`)

### State Management

- Local state (`useState`) for UI-only state
- Context/Zustand for cross-component global state
- Server state via React Query/SWR for API data

### Authentication Flow

- Public routes: Landing pages, Application submission, Status tracking (OTP-verified)
- Protected routes: All dashboards (role-based JWT authentication)
- RLS policies enforce data access at database level

### API Design

- RESTful endpoints with role-based authorization
- `/api/v1/public/*` - Guest APIs (OTP-restricted)
- `/api/v1/admin/*` - Admin-only operations
- All endpoints return structured responses with error codes

## Task Master Integration

This project uses Task Master AI for task-driven development. See `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive workflow guidance.

**Key Task Master Commands:**

```bash
task-master list                    # Show all tasks
task-master next                    # Get next available task
task-master show <id>               # View task details
task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done  # Complete task
```

**Important:** After completing tasks, create test scripts and verify the build succeeds before marking as complete.

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches from `main` (e.g., `feature/guest-application`, `fix/otp-verification`)
- Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`)
- All commits should reference task IDs when applicable (e.g., `feat: implement OTP verification (task 2.3)`)

## Security & Compliance

### DPDP Act Compliance

- Encryption: AES-256 for PII
- Signed URLs for all student documents
- Data minimization: Applications archived (PII stripped) after 1 year of rejection/exit
- Consent tracking: Digital fingerprints captured at every 6-month renewal

### Security Checklist

- Never commit API keys, credentials, or sensitive data
- All user input must be validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all database tables

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Utility functions and business logic
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints with role-based access
- **E2E Tests:** Complete user flows (Application → Approval → Room Allocation)
- All tests run against consistent mock data

- The `.docs/` folder contains complete specifications. Reference these documents when implementing features.
- All development should follow the Guest-First architecture pattern.
- Every feature should consider the multi-role access model and audit requirements.

## CLI TOOLING & ENVIRONMENT

I have installed specialized CLI utilities to speed up your workflow. You must use these specific binaries instead of standard Unix tools whenever possible.

### 1. SEARCH (Use `rg`)

- **Tool:** `ripgrep`
- **Binary Name:** `rg`
- **Instruction:** Always use `rg` instead of `grep` or `find`. It is faster and respects `.gitignore` automatically.
- **Typical Usage:** `rg -n "search_term" src/` (Shows line numbers).

### 2. NAVIGATION (Use `zoxide`)

- **Tool:** `zoxide`
- **Binary Name:** `zoxide`
- **Instruction:** Use `zoxide query <name>` to find directory paths if you are unsure of the exact location.
- **Typical Usage:**
  - To find a path: `zoxide query my-project`
  - To move (if shell allows): `cd $(zoxide query my-project)`

### 3. CONTEXT GATHERING (Use `repomix`)

- **Tool:** `repomix`
- **Binary Name:** `repomix`
- **Instruction:** Use this to read multiple files at once. It packs the repository content into a single, LLM-friendly XML format.
- **Typical Usage:** `repomix src/components --style xml` (Then read the output).
- **Strategy for context gathering** run after successful build completion

### 4. STRUCTURAL SEARCH (Use `sg`)

- **Tool:** `ast-grep`
- **Binary Name:** `sg`
- **Instruction:** Use this for complex code queries (finding patterns, not just text).
- **Typical Usage:** `sg run -p 'console.log($$$)'`

### 5. SEARCH STRATEGY: `rg` vs `sg`

You must choose the right tool based on what you are looking for. Follow this decision matrix:

**A. Use `rg` (Ripgrep) when:**

1.  **Finding Literals:** Searching for exact strings, error codes (e.g., "Error: 500"), or TODO comments.
2.  **Simple References:** Finding where a variable name is mentioned (e.g., `user_id`).
3.  **File Finding:** Locating files by name/path.
4.  **Speed:** You need a quick "grep" of the codebase.

**B. Use `sg` (AST-Grep) when:**

1.  **Multi-line Logic:** You need to find a function call that might be split across lines (e.g., a function with many arguments).
2.  **Syntax Specifics:** You need to find "all function definitions" (not calls) or "all try/catch blocks".
3.  **Refactoring:** You need to replace a pattern safely without breaking syntax.
4.  **Ignoring Formatting:** You want to find code regardless of spaces, tabs, or newlines.

**C. The Fallback Rule:**

- Start with `rg` for initial discovery.
- If `rg` returns too much noise (false positives) or misses multi-line occurrences, switch to `sg`.

### ERROR HANDLING

If a specific tool command fails (e.g., "command not found"), immediately fall back to standard tools (`grep`, `find`, `cat`) without asking for permission.
Check that pages are not using any hard coded data which is not connected to database
Check if Page is using post method and API calls using Put or vice versa
